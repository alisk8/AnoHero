# AnoHero
An app that allows to you freely and anonymously contact and connect with your teachers

## Inspiration
Learning almost explicitly depends on asking questions and clearing doubts about concepts you are confused about and it can be absolutely detrimental for learners if they don't ask questions. AnoHero is directly inspired by and directed towards students who for some specific reasons struggle asking questions, especially students with a restricted/introverted nature. An introverted student would most likely struggle with asking their teachers questions because of their reticent nature. A student with learning disabilities may struggle to ask questions for their fear of either being judged by their peers and/or their teachers. Students may even hesitate in asking questions because they think it will make their teacher unhappy that they weren't paying attention prior. Student fear in the classroom has become a serious issue and is only getting worse by limiting learners and not letting them reach heir full potential. Students being afraid to ask questions and open themselves up will do nothing but lead them to gain flawed education. AnoHero counters just this problem by allowing all students an equal opportunity for education and helps students reach their best potential by making their learning and question-asking experience easier.

## What it does
AnoHero consists of three features that aim to provide aid to students struggling to ask questions. The first feature is the 'Chat App' feature. The **Chat App** feature requires the teacher of the class to make a unique PIN code for the class chat server and then provide and limit the PIN to all the students in their class. The students can join the server with a random anonymous name and the unique PIN and then ask class related questions without revealing their identity. This feature aims to minimize students' fear of being jugged for asking questions and the anonymity helps students overcome being introverted/restricted. 

The second feature is the  **Challenges** feature. This feature allows students to challenge themselves with random everyday tasks they can do to improve their social skills, overcome shyness, overcome fear of being judged, develop self confidence, and also develop and improve their question asking skills.

The third and the last feature is the **Article Gallery** feature. Students can come in this space and read and even publish their own articles they think might be useful for other students sharing the same problems as them. Students may read the pre-selected articles published on to the website and improve their skills or they can upload new articles on to the website which they deem helpful.

## How we built it
AnoHero extensively uses the three fundamental languages for Web Development: HTML, CS, and JS to make all the features possible. We did not use any extra framework. The 'Chat App' feature uses Firebase app and Firebase Realtime Database to deliver and make visible chats/messages almost instantly. The 'Challenges' feature uses a simple array of numerous challenges and the user's click on the 'generate challenge' button randomly generates a challenge for them to complete making use of the  Math library of JavaScript. The 'Article Gallery' feature is made with intelligently pre-selected articles that may benefit the user and this feature also makes use of the Firebase Realtime Database and app to allow students to upload their own articles which they think may be useful for other students. 

## Challenges we ran into
How to create multiple chat servers so that multiple classes can be incorporated while using up the least storage possible. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to complete this project and were able to publish this project on the internet for people to actually benefit from it and we were proud that we might possibly influence a learner/student in a positive way.

## What we learned
Learned how to use Firebase Database to upload and receive instantaneous updates on the website. We also learned how to request and listen for any updates in the database and how to push something to the database. Learned new CSS styling tips and tricks. Learned how to publish a website to the internet using Netlify and gained some expertise in GitHub.

## What's next for AnoHero
We plan on expanding AnoHero by adding new features like giving the teachers the ability to create multiple chat servers for different classes and making the current features even stronger. We also plan on raising more and more awareness about how important education and learning is through this platform. Lastly, we plan on publicizing AnoHero around the world so more people can benefit from this technology.
